Hi, this is Tiffany, Jan, Karolina, Holger & Malte, the JSConf EU curators.

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce **JSConf EU 2017**! Thatâ€™s right, [together with CSSconf EU](), we will return only a few months later than usual, in **spring 2017** (May 6-7 2017).

We don't want to reveal too much yet, but we're super excited about our new amazing venue.

See you all at JSConf EU ðŸ‘‹
Tiffany, Jan, Karolina, Holger & Malte
