Mark your calendars: The Ticket Sale for JSConf EU 2015 will start on Sunday, February 1st at 18:00 CET.


JSConf EU is a professional, not-for-profit, labour-of-love conference for the JavaScript community that you don’t want to miss out on – Read up on the [JSConf EU experience and what a ticket buys you]({{ site.baseurl }}/why/ "WHY JSConf EU").

### Diversity Support Tickets

[Expanding on our program from last year](http://2014.jsconf.eu/news/2014/08/15/diversity-tickets.html) we are again offering [Diversity Support Tickets](/diversity-tickets). As last year you are purchasing a ticket for yourself and help another person of the conference's choosing to be able to attend the event.

To make the program even more accessible we now offer a wider range of "Support Options". Starting with paying 25% of a ticket to paying for a full ticket. We thank you in advance for your generosity and awesomeness and looking forward to a more diverse JSConf EU than ever before.
