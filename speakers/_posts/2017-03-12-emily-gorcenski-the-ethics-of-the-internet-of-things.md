description: 'The Internet of Things is quickly entering our lives with stunning feats of innovation--and sometimes absurdity. Internet connectivity in household and industrial devices truly holds a great deal of promise, but is the pace of innovation too fast and is the design praxis sufficiently rigorous? Is JavaScript well-suited to control devices that can cause material and physical harm? By way of case study, this talk explores ethical issues with IoT technologies and transfers lessons learned from biomedical, automotive, and aerospace engineering industries.'
