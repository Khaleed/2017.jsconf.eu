description: "\nEvery talk you'll hear about 'web performance' will tell you that shaving 100ms from response time produced a 1% sales yield for Amazon, or maybe that 40% of web visitors will abandon your site when it takes more then 3 seconds to load? While those are *impressive*, there are some more interesting metrics that we need to talk about. \n\nDid you know that 43% of the humans on this planet have access to the internet, but 57% do not? Did you know that in 2016 India brought 100 million NEW users to the internet for the very first time? When you take a glance into the current state of global connectivity, you might realise that the internet you think you know so well exists on an entirely different plane.\n\nThrough the guise of user-experience and empathy, we'll study the state of global connectivity, connection speeds, population, and the costs of data in order to re-centre how we think about our role as designers and developers for the web today.
