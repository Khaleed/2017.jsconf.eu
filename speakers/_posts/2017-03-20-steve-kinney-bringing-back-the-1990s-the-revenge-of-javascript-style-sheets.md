  JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) was a technology introduced by Netscape in 1996.
  Chances are, you’ve never heard of JSSS, since it was available in Netscape
  Communicator 4.0. They allowed you to define custom styling rules for your web
  pages. You’re probably more familiar with its competitor at the time—CSS. They
  were pretty cool though. JSSS allowed the developer to style the DOM using
  a full programming language with variables, conditionals, and functions.



  The obvious spoiler alert here is that CSS won and JSSS lost, right? It’s not
  that simple. A lot of the ideas from JSSS have slowly been creeping back into
  our toolset. SASS brought programming logic back into styling our applications.
  CSS picked up variables and the ability to do calculations. Finally, the React
  community has been—maybe unknowingly—bringing JSSS back from the dead. In this
  talk, we’ll take a good hard look at JSSS and the ways in which JSSS has had
  enduring legacy after its untimely demise.
