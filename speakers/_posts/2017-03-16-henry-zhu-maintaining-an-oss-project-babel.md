description: "I would like to explain what goes into maintaining one of the biggest tools used in the JavaScript ecosystem. I will talk about going from not knowing about the project to becoming a user, contributor, and maintainer. Maintenance isn't just about triaging issues/merging PRs, but working with the community, other projects, and mentoring new contributors. I'l go over things we've learned and what the future may hold for the project/OSS in general."
