  Every other week there seems to be a new dump of cracked passwords, hurting
  innocent and unbeknownst users. It seems as if keeping users passwords safe is
  an herculean task, even beyond the most resourceful organisations. However it
  doesn't have to be.



  Password hashing is a important discipline in cryptography. Securing passwords
  has become so integral to our society that in 2013 a Password Hashing
  Competition was announced, for the academic community to band together and
  develop a common recommendation for future use. In this talk I'll showcase how
  to handle passwords correctly and safely and clear out misinformation that is
  still abound in tutorials and blog posts. All with heaps of demos to motivate,
  make the material concrete and so everyone can follow along!
