description: 'In this talk, I’ll share with you what it was like for me to be a new programmer from a minority background in the JavaScript community. We’ll then discuss some ideas for creating more welcoming environments.

Working on my own startup where the runway was getting shorter and the product wasn’t taking off as expected, I decided to pull the plug and focus on learning how to program. I encountered a variety of challenges when I started out in the JavaScript world. I tried participating in various communities but felt out of place, found asking questions difficult, and rarely met anyone from a similar background. We’ll talk about how I overcame obstacles and offer some suggestions on lowering the barriers to entry.'
