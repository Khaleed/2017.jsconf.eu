description: "Of course *you* know what beautiful code looks like. Too bad nobody actually agrees with you. So, what exactly makes beautiful code? Is it readability? Elegance? Simplicity? How much of it depends on the programming language, on your coding style and on the actual code you're writing? The presentation will contain nothing but code and thus the talk will be largely non-technical."
