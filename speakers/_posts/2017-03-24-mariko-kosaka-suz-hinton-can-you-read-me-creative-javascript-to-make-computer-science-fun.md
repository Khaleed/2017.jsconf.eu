description: >-
  Two web developers who are full of curiosity to learn all about machines and
  code met at a meetup. Unsatisfied with traditional computer science textbook
  and what we felt like not so learner friendly software engineering landscape,
  we decided to learn by working together in the format we enjoy the most
  - creative project.



  We are building machines (both software and hardware) in JavaScript to send
  secret messages to each other. Different forms of data blob are exchanged
  periodically as a message. In order to read those messages, each has to learn
  and build a system to decode the data.



  This talk will tell the story of the machines, their parts, and the
  possibilities of remote creative collaboration. You’ll come away with fresh
  inspiration on how JavaScript can be used to learn computer science concepts
  the enjoyable way.
