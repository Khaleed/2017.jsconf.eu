description: "Today’s Javascript developers are working at an intersection of user experience, security, and the next generation of connected technologies. With the growth of full-stack JS tools and the expansion of the Internet of Things, robust Javascript applications will play an even bigger role in the devices and tools we use every day. \n\nWith this great power comes an even greater responsibility to our users, and to their privacy and safety. How can we advocate for and build the future of usable and trustworthy security? We'll discuss real-life examples of improving the user experience of security tools for generalist developers, and learn some key tactics for user advocacy."
