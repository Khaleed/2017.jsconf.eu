description: 'Every time I have to check the "Male" or "Female" boxes, it feels :poop emoji:. By building and shipping expanded gender options at my $DAYJOB, I learned how to convince folks that gender options in product matter, how to get time and resourcing for social justice projects at work, and how to measure the success of a feature that only a small portion of users interact with.'
