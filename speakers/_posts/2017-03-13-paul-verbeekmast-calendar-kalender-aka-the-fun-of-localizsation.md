  In a few months time, I had created a new calendar for our partners at
  Booking.com. Months? Yes, months. Creating a calendar that works correctly all
  across the world for 42 different languages and even more locales, is not
  something that you do in a week.

  In this talk I will talk to you about the weird things I learned. From
  Brazilian Summer Time and Slovakian date formatting, to surprises in
  open-sources libraries and dealing with wrong assumptions. And how to avoid the
  many (many!) mistakes I made.
