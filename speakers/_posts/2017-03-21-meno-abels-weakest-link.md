description: "Https is the new normal. \nWe all knew that the [CAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) are not working properly. \nThe chain of trust between the website and \"me\" is founded on the believe of the \"green lock\".\nIf we dissect this chain of trust we find the \"weakest link\" the private-key's. \nThis discovery leads to question how we manage our digital identity. \nAnd leave the unanswered question, how could we rebuild trust?"
